# Parental Portal - Blockchain Wallet Monitoring System

# üßø Parental View Portal

Parental View Portal is a blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp) designed to let parents monitor child activity on the blockchain through read-only smart contract access ‚Äî without having the ability to modify anything.

## üõ† Features

- üîê Read-only access to child smart contract activity
- üìä Simple UI for monitoring and selecting children accounts
- ‚öôÔ∏è Integrated with deployed Clarity smart contract
- üßæ Privacy-focused: no write permissions or private data stored

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Run the App

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd parental-view-frontend

# Installation & Setup Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Install dependencies (only once):
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The app will automatically open in your default browser at:
```arduino
http://localhost:3000
```

## üìÑ Smart Contract

The Clarity smart contract is already deployed on the Stacks blockchain at the following address:

```
ST1RT23XAS4TWJJ2GEXDT7C7VBMKXC5PN59RGWCH0.portal
```

## üîß Configuration

Make sure your `src/utils/contractCalls.js` file has the correct contract address:

```javascript
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'ST1RT23XAS4TWJJ2GEXDT7C7VBMKXC5PN59RGWCH0';
const CONTRACT_NAME = 'portal';
```

## üì± Usage

1. **Connect your Stacks wallet** (Hiro Wallet recommended)
2. **Switch to testnet** in your wallet settings
3. **Get testnet STX** from the [faucet](https://explorer.stacks.co/sandbox/faucet) if needed
4. **Register child wallets** and start monitoring!

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- Ensure you're connected to **testnet**
- Check you have **testnet STX** for transaction fees
- Verify the **contract address** is correctly configured
- Make sure your **wallet is connected**

Happy monitoring! üéâ

## Project Description

The Parental Portal is a innovative blockchain-based smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity language. This system enables parents to monitor and track their children's cryptocurrency wallet activities in a transparent, secure, and decentralized manner. The contract provides a comprehensive framework for parental oversight of digital asset management, ensuring responsible financial education and safety for young crypto users.

The system allows parents to register their children's wallet addresses and log various transaction activities, creating an immutable record of financial interactions. This promotes transparency, accountability, and helps parents guide their children in developing healthy digital financial habits.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to bridge the gap between traditional parental guidance and modern digital finance by creating a trustless, blockchain-based monitoring system that:

- **Promotes Financial Literacy**: Help children learn about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology under parental guidance
- **Ensures Safety**: Provide parents with the tools to monitor and protect their children from potential crypto-related risks
- **Builds Trust**: Create transparency between parents and children regarding digital asset management
- **Encourages Responsibility**: Foster responsible financial behavior in the next generation of crypto users
- **Maintains Privacy**: Utilize blockchain's inherent privacy features while providing necessary oversight

We envision a future where blockchain technology serves as a foundation for safe, educational, and responsible introduction of children to the world of digital finance.

```clarity
;; Register a child's wallet
(contract-call? .parental-portal register-child-wallet 'SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRR6F44)

;; Log a transaction activity
(contract-call? .parental-portal log-child-activity 
    'SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRR6F44 
    "STX Transfer" 
    u1000000 
    (some 'SP3FBR2AGK5H9QBDH3EEN6DF8EK8JY7RX8QJ5SVTE) 
    (some "Allowance payment"))
```

## Security Considerations

- Only parents can register and monitor their children's wallets
- All data is stored immutably on the blockchain
- Access control mechanisms prevent unauthorized monitoring
- Smart contract code is open-source and auditable
